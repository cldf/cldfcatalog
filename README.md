Research data - and in particular CLDF data - is often curated using `git` repositories
for version control. [`cldfcatalog.Repository`](src/cldfcatalog/repository.py) 
provides a wrapper around GitPython's `git.Repo` class, exposing relevant functionality 
in this context.

A particularly important piece of data for CLDF are reference catalogs, which are
consulted during CLDF data creation. Again, such catalogs are often available as
`git` repositories hosted on GitHub, such as 
[Glottolog](https://github.com/glottolog/glottolog) or
[Concepticon](https://github.com/concepticon/concepticon-data).

The typical usage scenario for these catalogs is as follows: 
- To follow upstream development of the catalogs, a user has a local clone of the
  repository, which is periodically synched running `git pull origin`.
- When creating a CLDF dataset, a particular released version of a catalog is consulted.

Thus, we want to 
- checkout a particular version of the catalog,
- run the CLDF creation,
- restore the previous state of the repository clone.

This is exactly the functionality of [`cldfcatalog.Catalog`](src/cldfcatalog/catalog.py):
```python
>>> from cldfcatalog import Catalog
>>> glottolog = Catalog('../../glottolog/glottolog', 'v4.0')
>>> glottolog.active_branch
'master'
>>> with glottolog:
...     print(glottolog.describe())
...     
v4.0
>>> glottolog.describe()
'v4.0-52-ga4cfc90'
```


## Configuration

`cldfcatalog` supports discovery of local paths to catalog clones via a configuration file.
If a file `catalog.ini` is found at `appdirs.user_config_dir('cldf')` (see [appdirs](https://pypi.org/project/appdirs/)) is found, its `clones` section is used as a
mapping from `Catalog.cli_name()` to clone path. Thus, with a configuration
```ini
[clones]
clts = /home/forkel/.config/cldf/clts
```
a catalog can be intialized as
```python
with Catalog.from_config('clts', tag='v1.0'):
    ...
```

When cloning a catalog,
running `Catalog.clone`,`appdirs.user_config_dir('cldf')` will be used as directory for
the clone, and the path will be written to the config file.

To add add paths to a config file use it as context manager:
```python
from cldfcatalog import Config

with Config.from_file() as cfg:
    cfg.add_clone(key, path)
```
